# CS330

Before this course I had never used OpenGL, or any other graphics renderer. So mostly everything was new to me. I found it interesting to learn about the different perspectives and ways that 3D scenes are created in respect to the "camera." I have not thought much about that process before. Adding textures and lighting to the scene was also new to me. Lighting and coloring were the aspects of my scene that I had the most difficulty with. After a lot of trial and error, I think the lighting turned out pretty good. However, I was having trouble getting the objects to appear the exact color that I wanted under the lighting. The types of skills that I developed throughout the last two months could definitely help me in my future career. I am not sure exactly what type of job that I will end up getting after I graduate, so there is a chance that 3D graphic rendering could be part of my career. I spoke to my brother, who is a software engineer, and he mentioned that he used OpenGL at one of his previous places of employment. Even if I don't end up working with anything related to the topics covered in this class, it is still important to have a diverse field of knowledge. I could expand on these skills by furthering my education on the topic. Perhaps I could take another course in computer graphics, or by working through tutorials online.
